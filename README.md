# ClassifiAI
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 RGB images of 10 different classes, each with 6,000 images. Those classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. We chose to model this dataset using a series of machine learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, feedforward neural network, and convolutional neural network. We sought to understand the dataset by visualizing the dataset as images (see Figure 2.1 below) and reading through existing papers. 
“CIFAR-10: KNN-based Ensemble of Classifiers” from The American University in Cairo was particularly helpful. It compares the performances of training the CIFAR-10 dataset on the classifiers, k-nearest neighbors and convolutional neural network. It was concluded that the performance of convolutional neural network improved when paired with the use of k-nearest neighbors and was able to better classify the different images in the dataset. From this paper, we learned the effectiveness of combining multiple classifiers and found a reference accuracy to compare our own results to (they achieved a whopping 94.03% accuracy!).
