# ClassifiAI
We explored the effectiveness of different classifiers on the CIFAR-10 dataset, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), feedforward neural networks (FFN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our convolutional neural network significantly outperformed the other classifiers with a test accuracy of 66.4%.
